>React has the same events as HTML :click,change,mouseover etc
>React events are written in camelCase syntax:
e.q.=>onClick instead of onClick


>React events handlers are written inside curly braces:
e.q.=>onClick={shoot} instead of onClick="shoot()".
React:
<button onClick={shoot}>Take the shot!</button>
HTML:
<button onclick="shoot()">Take the shot!</button>


>whenever pass "function argument" in event you have to use arrow function.
